            "Sholay (, meaning \"Embers\") is a 1975 Indian Hindi-language action-adventure film directed by Ramesh Sippy and produced by his father G. P. Sippy. The film follows two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan), hired by a retired police officer (Sanjeev Kumar) to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests. Sholay is considered a classic and one of the best Indian films. It was ranked first in the British Film Institute's 2002 poll of \"Top 10 Indian Films\" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards named it the Best Film of 50 Years. The film was shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the southern state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198 minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay is the highest grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The film drew heavily from the conventions of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format."

The film is considered to be one of the lengthiest films of Indian cinema. After Sangam became a blockbuster, Mera Naam Joker was highly anticipated as it was six years in the making and was heavily publicized to be loosely based on Raj Kapoor's own life. Upon release the film turned out to be a critical and commercial disaster putting Kapoor into a financial crisis. The film was heavily panned for its length and plot. However, over the years, the film has gained a cult status and is regarded as a classic today. Both audience's and critics' response has turned highly favorable with the passage of time. An abridged version was released in the 1980s and had a highly successful run at the box office. Raj Kapoor termed this his favorite film and described it as having deep philosophical depth and meaning. The film is regarded as one of Kapoor's finest works today with film experts labeling it a 'misunderstood masterpiece'."

            "Amar Akbar Anthony is a 1977 Indian action comedy film produced and directed by Manmohan Desai. The film, which is based on the lost and found theme, is about three brothers separated from their parents and each other in childhood, and raised in three different faiths, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. They unite in their youth to fight a common villain. It was the biggest blockbuster of 1977, and won several awards at 25th Filmfare Awards including Best Actor, Best Music Director and Best Editing. The film stars three actors: Amitabh Bachchan (as Anthony Gonsalves), Vinod Khanna (as Amar Khanna) and Rishi Kapoor (as Akbar Allahabadi). Each of the heroes had an affiliation with a heroine; these women were played by Parveen Babi, Shabana Azmi and Neetu Singh. Nirupa Roy, Pran and Jeevan played supporting roles. The music was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Kishore Kumar sang for Bachchan and Mohammed Rafi sang for Kapoor. The soundtrack was one of Mukesh's last soundtracks with Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Anand Bakshi was the lyricist. The film about religious tolerance became a landmark in Bollywood masala films. It also had a lasting impact of the pop culture, with its catchy songs, one-liners and the character of Anthony Gonsalves played by Amitabh Bachchan. It was later remade in Tamil as Shankar Salim Simon (1978), in Telugu as Ram Robert Rahim (1980) and in Malayalam as John Jaffer Janardhanan (1982)."

            "Amar Prem (translation: Immortal Love) is a 1972 Indian drama film directed by Shakti Samanta, based on a Bengali short story Hinger Kochuri by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay about a school boy, who is ill-treated by his step mother, and becomes friends with a prostitute neighbour. The film stars Sharmila Tagore playing a prostitute with a heart of gold, with Rajesh Khanna in the role of a lonely businessman, and Vinod Mehra as adult Nandu, the young child, who they both come to care for. The film is noted for its music by R.D. Burman, numbers sung by famous playback singers like Kishore Kumar, R.D. Burman's father S.D. Burman and Lata Mangeshkar; lyrics were by Anand Bakshi. The thought-provoking song Chingaari Koi Bhadke written by Anand Bakshi and sung by Kishore Kumar, is one of the highlights of this classic. The song topped at 5th position on year-end chart toppers list Binaca Geetmala annual list 1972. The film is a remake of a Bengali film Nishi Padma (1970) directed by Arabinda Mukherjee, who wrote screenplay for both the films; it starred Uttam Kumar and Sabitri Chatterjee as leads. The film portrays the decline of human values and relationships and contrasts it by presenting an illustrious example of a boy's innocent love for a neighbourhood courtesan."

It stars Anil Kapoor, Sridevi and Amrish Puri in the lead roles The film was the highest grossing Indian film of 1987, and remains a cult classic in India. The film was known for several of its lines and songs, including Sridevi's Miss Hawa Hawaii performance, and Amrish Puri's quote \"Mogambo khush hua\" (Mogambo is pleased), which is one of the most famous quotes of Bollywood and became synonymous with Puri. The Mogambo character is also considered to be one of the best villains in Bollywood history. Laxmikant-Pyarelal's music performed well too, especially the song Hawa Hawaii which is very popular till today. The film has often been featured in different lists of top Bollywood films. Indiatimes Movies ranks the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. This was the last film that the writing duo Salim-Javed wrote together. They had split up earlier in 1982, but came back for one last film. On the centenary of Indian Cinema, Mr. India has been declared one of the 100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time. Interestingly Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan were offered the lead role, but they turned it down as they couldn't relate with the invisible hero."

The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy after the super success of his previous venture, Sholay. The story was written by Salim-Javed. The film was expected to match the success of Sholay but failed to do so. The film however, ran to packed houses in its re-runs and made a lot of money. Eventually, it was declared to be the highest grosser of 1980 by IBOS. It did obtain the services of Sholay's music composer, R.D. Burman, whose songs for the film provided it with a Best Music nomination at Filmfare, this being its sole nomination."

            "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (English: The Big-Hearted Will Take Away the Bride), also known by the initialism DDLJ, is an Indian romance film written and directed by Aditya Chopra and produced by Yash Chopra. Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son. The film was shot in India, London and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995. Earning \u20b91.06 billion (valued at about US$32,766,000 in 1995) in India and \u20b9160 million (valued at about US$4,946,000 in 1995) overseas, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge became the highest grossing Bollywood film of the year, and one of the most successful Indian films of all time. It won 10 Filmfare Awards, the most for a single film at that time, and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s. Many critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema. As of 2016, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai."

Starring Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan, it celebrates Indian wedding traditions by relating to the story of a married couple and the relationship between their families; a story about sacrificing ones love for ones family. It is an adaptation of the studio's own Bhojpuri film Nadiya Ke Paar (1982). Earning over \u20b91.35 billion (US$20 million) worldwide, the film became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time. It contributed to a change in the Indian film industry, with new methods of distribution and a turn towards less violent stories. It was the first Hindi film to gross over \u20b91 billion, and when adjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing Hindi film of the 1990s and also still one of the highest-earning Bollywood films ever. Box Office India described it as \"the biggest blockbuster of the modern era.\" The 14-song soundtrack, an unusually large number, is also one of the most popular in Bollywood history, with popular singer Lata Mangeshkar lending her voice for 11 of the 14 songs in the film. Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! won five Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress, as well as winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It made a lasting impact on wedding celebrations in India, which often include songs and games from the film."

            "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (English: Something Happens) also known as KKHH, is an Indian Hindi coming-of-age romantic comedy drama film, released in India and the United Kingdom on 16 October 1998. It was written and directed by Karan Johar, and starred the popular on-screen pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in their fourth film together. Rani Mukerji featured in a supporting role, while Salman Khan had an extended guest appearance. Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, this was Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his goals for the film was to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema. The plot combines two love triangles set years apart. The first half covers friends on a college campus, while the second tells the story of a widower's young daughter who tries to reunite her dad with his old friend. The film was extremely successful in India and abroad, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of the year and the third highest-grossing Indian film ever behind Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The film was also the first Bollywood film to enter the UK cinema top ten. Outside India, the film was the highest grossing Hindi film ever until its record was broken by Karan's next directorial, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). Kuch Kuch Hota Hai received a positive reception from critics, with special praise directed to Kajol's performance. The soundtrack also became the biggest seller of the year. The film won many major awards including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the \"Best Film\" honor at the Filmfare Awards, Zee Cine Awards, Screen Awards, and Bollywood Movie Awards. The film won 8 Filmfare Awards and is the only film in history to win all the four acting category awards at the ceremony (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor & Best Supporting Actress). The film remains highly popular on Indian television and has achieved a cult classic status."

It is a contemporary thriller about a young man who stops at nothing to get what he wants. This was Shah Rukh Khan's breakthrough role as the sole lead and Kajol's first commercial success. Actress Shilpa Shetty was supposed to debut with film Gaata Rahe Mera Dil, however, the film remained unreleased and this was her debut movie. Baazigar was the first film in which Shah Rukh Khan played the role of an anti-hero and also the first film which earned Khan a Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Initially Salman Khan was the first choice to play the lead in the film. Baazigar was a major commercial success at the time of its release and the first film of the famous Shahrukh Khan-Kajol pair. The film was remade in Tamil as Samrat with Ramki, in Telugu as Vetagaadu with Rajasekhar and in Kannada as Nagarahavu with Upendra. The film brought actors Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Shilpa Shetty and composer Anu Malik to the limelight. It is a remake of the 1991 Hollywood film A Kiss Before Dying."

It stars Amitabh Bachchan as the protagonist Vijay Deenanath Chauhan along with Mithun Chakraborty, Madhavi, Neelam Kothari, Rohini Hattangadi and Danny Denzongpa as the antagonist Kancha Cheena. The film was produced by Yash Johar. The title was taken from a poem of the same name called 'Agneepath' which was penned by Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh's father, and which is recited at the beginning of the movie and creates a thematic link that continues through the movie, particularly in the climax, both literally and metaphorically. Agneepath has grown a strong cult film over the years. Amitabh Bachchan received his first National Film Award for Best Actor at the 38th National Film Awards for his performance. Mithun Chakraborty received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. The film was remade in 2012 with the same title, by Johar's son Karan Johar, as a tribute to his father. The film, despite being the tenth highest-grosser of 1990, had collections way below its high budget, and thus, the film recorded as flop at the box-office."

It stars Arvind Swamy and Madhoo in the lead roles. The film was also dubbed in Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam and Telugu languages. The film won three National Film Awards, including Best Film on National Integration, catapulting Ratnam to national acclaim. The film also gained international acclaim with its nomination for Best Film at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. The film was later re-released for international audiences in light of the growing fear of terrorist attacks across the world. It is the first in Ratnam's trilogy of films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, including Bombay (1995) and Dil Se.. (1998). The film's successful and acclaimed score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, who debuted as a film composer with this film. He won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, Filmfare Award for Best Music Director - Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director for his work in his debut film. This soundtrack is among the \"10 Best Soundtracks\" of all time listed by TIME magazine, issued in 2005."

            "Bombay is a 1995 Indian Tamil drama film directed by Mani Ratnam, starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala in the lead, and featuring music composed by A. R. Rahman. The film is centered on events that occurred particularly during the period of December 1992 to January 1993 in India, and the controversy surrounding the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, its subsequent demolition on 6 December 1992 and increased religious tensions in the city of Bombay (now Mumbai) that led to the Bombay Riots. It is the second in Ratnam's trilogy of films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, including Roja (1992) and Dil Se.. (1998). Eventually becoming one of the highest-grossing films of the Chennai film industry, the film was well-received both critically and commercially, and it was screened at many international film festivals including the Philadelphia Film Festival in 1996 where it was an audience favourite. The film's soundtrack sold 15 million units, becoming one of the best-selling film soundtracks of all time, and earning composer A. R. Rahman his fourth consecutive Filmfare Best Music Director Award (Tamil). However, the film caused considerable controversy upon release in India and abroad for its depiction of inter-religious relations and religious riots. The film was banned in Singapore and Malaysia upon release. In July 2005, a book on the film by Lalitha Gopalan was published by BFI Modern Classics, looking at the film's production, the several issues it covered, and its impact upon release in India and abroad. The film was ranked among the top 20 Indian films in the British Film Institute's rankings. The film was also dubbed in Hindi and Telugu.The film is loosely inspired by the 1990 movie Come See the Paradise."

The first film written and directed by Farhan Akhtar, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and Sydney, and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends. In 2001, the film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. It performed better in the urban areas of the country compared to the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the city-oriented lifestyle depicted in which all the characters are from rich or upper-middle-class families. Over the years, it has attained a cult status."

            "Lagaan (Hindi: \u0932\u0917\u093e\u0928, \"Taxation\"; also called Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India) is a 2001 Indian epic sports-drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. Aamir Khan, who was also the producer, stars with Gracy Singh in the lead roles; British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne play the supporting roles. Made on a then-unprecedented budget of \u20b9250 million (equivalent to \u20b9700 million or US$10 million in 2016), the film was shot in an ancient village near Bhuj, India. The film is set in the Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj. The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes. The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny. Lagaan received critical acclaim and awards at international film festivals, as well as many Indian film awards. It became the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). It was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001. In 2010, the film was ranked No. 55 in Empire magazines \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\". In 2011, it was listed in Time magazine's special \"The All-TIME 25 Best Sports Movies\". The film was screened retrospective as the Closing Film on August 18th 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day."

It was loosely adapted from the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. The film stars Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Parikshit Sahni and Boman Irani. Upon release, the film was the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend in India and had the highest opening day collections for an Indian film up until that point. It also held the record for the highest net collections in the first week for a Bollywood film. It also became one of the few Indian films to become successful in East Asian markets such as China, eventually bringing its overseas total to more than US$65 million at the time\u2014the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time in overseas markets, before being overtaken by Chennai Express in 2013. Over the years, it has attained the cult status. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people in India's backyards. The brains behind the innovations were Remya Jose, a student from Kerala, who created the exercise-bicycle/washing-machine; Mohammad Idris, a barber from Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, who invented a bicycle-powered horse clipper; and Jahangir Painter, a painter from Maharashtra, who made the scooter-powered flour mill. This film was remade in Tamil as Nanban (2012) which also received critical praise and commercial success. It has also been announced that there will be a Chinese remake of the film produced by Stephen Chow and that there are plans for a Hollywood remake produced in the United States. A Telugu remake was planned despite Nanban having a Telugu dubbed version titled Snehitudu."

Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Atul Kulkarni and British actress Alice Patten in the lead roles. Made on a budget of \u20b9250 million (US$3.7 million), it was shot in and around New Delhi. Upon release, the film broke all opening box office records in India. It was the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend in India and had the highest opening day collections for a Bollywood film. The film was well received and praised for strong screenplay and dialogues. The story is about a British documentary filmmaker who is determined to make a film on Indian freedom fighters based on diary entries by her grandfather, a former officer of the British Indian Army. Upon arriving in India, she asks a group of five young men to act in her film. Rang De Basanti's release faced stiff resistance from the Indian Defence Ministry and the Animal Welfare Board due to parts that depicted the use of MiG-21 fighter aircraft and a banned Indian horse race. The film was released globally on 26 January 2006, the Republic Day of India, it received critical acclaim winning National award for most popular film and it is also rated as 8.4 out of 10 on IMDB which is one of the highest among Bollywood films. It was subsequently nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 BAFTA Awards. Rang De Basanti was chosen as India's official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, though it did not ultimately yield a nomination for either award. A. R. Rahman's soundtrack, which earned positive reviews, had two of its tracks considered for the Academy Award nomination. The film was well received by critics and audiences for its production values and had a noticeable influence on Indian society. In India, Rang De Basanti did well at many of the Bollywood awards ceremonies, including a win for Best Movie at the Filmfare Awards. The film was declared \"Blockbuster\" by Box Office India."

            "A Wednesday! is a 2008 Indian drama thriller film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. It stars Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher in the lead roles. Set between 2 pm to 6 pm on a Wednesday, the film depicts an about-to-retire police commissioner (Anupam Kher) narrating a sequence of events that unfolded on a particular Wednesday. They do not exist in any written record, only in his mind and in those of several individuals who were involved, willingly and unwillingly, and how those events affected the lives of all the concerned people. It was the inspiration for Tamil movie Unnaipol Oruvan and Telugu movie Eeenadu, with Kamal Hassan donning the role played by Naseeruddin Shah in the original and Mohanlal and Daggubati Venkatesh playing the role acted by Anupam Kher in the original in Tamil and Telugu respectively. The film, made at a small budget, was a sleeper hit at the box office grossing over Rs. 340 million worldwide. Despite its low hype, it was a box office success due to critical acclaim and positive word-of-mouth. Box Office India declared it a hit. Critics credited the movie for its effective storyline and its twist ending. Subsequently, it won a number of awards including the Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director at the 56th National Film Awards."

Visual effects are by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs, and the title animation\u2014the first use of clay animation in a Bollywood film\u2014was created by Dhimant Vyas. Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy composed the film's score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in Mumbai and in Panchgani's New Era High School, and some of the school's students make appearances. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old dyslexic child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. The film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and UTV Home Entertainment released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. Disney's later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company. Taare Zameen Par has received numerous awards, including the Filmfare Best Film Award for 2008 and the 2008 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. It was India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but did not progress to the short-list."

            "Devdas is a 2002 Indian romantic drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and based on the 1917 Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel Devdas. This is the third Hindi version and the first film version of the story in Hindi done in colour. The film follows Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan), a wealthy law graduate in the early 1900s, who returns from his studies in London to marry his childhood sweetheart, Paro (Aishwarya Rai). However, the rejection of this marriage by his own family sparks his descent into alcohol, ultimately leading to his emotional deterioration. The film was screened retrospective, during the 2014 International Film Festival of India in the Celebrating Dance in Indian cinema section. Devdas was declared a hit in India by Box Office India and won the Filmfare Award for Best Film. The film also won five National Awards and a further nine Filmfare Awards, tied with Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge with the most Filmfare Awards any film had won at the time (later beaten in 2005 by Bhansali's Black). It was received well by western audiences alike and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was also India's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was ranked #74 in Empire magazines \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. Time Magazine  named Devdas as the best movie of 2002 among all the movies released around the world that year. The film was recently included in Time Magazine's top 10 movies of the millennium worldwide. The acting was seen by many as the primary factor for the film's success, with Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit all winning Filmfare Awards for their performances. The film's success was also attributed to the dance performances, with Dixit's \"Maar Daala\" considered one of the most iconic of her career and the song \"Dola Re Dola\" becoming a hit due to the unique dance duet between Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit, two of the leading actresses of the epoch. At the time of its release, Devdas was the most expensive Bollywood film ever produced, with a reported budget of \u20b950 crore (US$7.4 million). The film was a major commercial success in India and abroad, becoming the highest grossing Indian film of the year."

            "Veer-Zaara is a 2004 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in the leading roles, with Rani Mukerji, Manoj Bajpayee, Kirron Kher, Divya Dutta and Anupam Kher in supporting roles. Veteran actors Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini make a special appearance in the film. The film's story and dialogues were written by Aditya Chopra. Set against the backdrop of conflict between India and Pakistan, this star-crossed romance follows the unfortunate love story of an Indian Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh and a Pakistani woman hailing from a rich political family of Lahore, Zaara Hayat Khan, who are separated for 22 years. Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer, finds Veer in prison and upon listening to his story, tries to get him freed. Highly anticipated pre-release, the film eventually became the top-grossing Bollywood film of the year at both the Indian and the international box office, earning over \u20b9942.2 million (US$14 million) worldwide, in addition to being showcased at numerous prominent film festivals around the world. The music of the film, based on old compositions by the late Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, was also successful. Upon its theatrical release, Veer-Zaara received mostly positive reviews from critics & called as Romantic film of year 2004. The film won several awards in major Indian film award ceremonies, including the Most Popular Film award at the National Film Awards and the Filmfare Award for Best Film, among others."

Gadar: Ek Prem Katha was a box office phenomenon and sold more tickets at theatres in India than any film in history apart from Sholay (1975). When Gadar was released on 15 June 2001, producer for Zee Telefilms, Nitin Keni, director Anil Sharma, lead star Sunny Deol, assorted trade pundits, and seasoned film critics had no idea that the film, which was set during a turbulent time in modern Indian history, would create box-office history. Gadar clashed with Aamir Khan's Lagaan at the box office. Made for \u20b9185 million (US$2.7 million), Gadar has made more than \u20b9600 million (US$8.9 million) and after its theatrical run, was commercially one of the most successful movies in India when it was released. It is in list of \"One of the Biggest Blockbusters in Hindi Cinema\". Gadar: Ek Prem Katha is the most watched Hindi film in India as it recorded 5.05 crore footfalls in India. The shy role of Sunny Deol was admired and led to the Filmfare nomination for the best actor. The story of this film is loosely based on the real life of Boota Singh."

            "Kahaani (IPA: [k\u0259\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0ni]; \"Story\") is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language mystery thriller film co-written, co-produced and directed by Sujoy Ghosh. It stars Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in Kolkata during the festival of Durga Puja, assisted by Satyoki \"Rana\" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee) and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Made on a shoestring budget of \u20b980 million (US$1.2 million), Kahaani was conceived and developed by Ghosh, who co-wrote the film with Advaita Kala. The crew often employed guerrilla-filmmaking techniques on Kolkata's city streets to avoid attracting attention. The film was noted for its deft portrayal of the city and for making use of many local crew and cast members. Kahaani explores themes of feminism and motherhood in male-dominated Indian society. The film also makes several allusions to Satyajit Ray's films such as Charulata (1964) and Aranyer Dinratri (1970). Kahaani was released worldwide on 9 March 2012. Critics praised the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Following critical acclaim and word-of-mouth publicity, the film earned \u20b91.04 billion (US$15 million) worldwide in 50 days. The film won several awards, including three National Film Awards and five Filmfare Awards. The latter included trophies for Best Director (Ghosh) and Best Actress (Vidya). A sequel, starring Vidya and Arjun Rampal, is in production."

            "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (English: You won't get this life again) is a 2011 Indian coming-of-age comedy-drama road film directed by Zoya Akhtar and produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani of Excel Entertainment. The film features an ensemble cast including Hrithik Roshan as Arjun, Abhay Deol as Kabir and Farhan Akhtar as Imraan. It also stars Katrina Kaif as Laila, Kalki Koechlin as Natasha, and Ariadna Cabrol as Nuria along with Naseeruddin Shah making a special appearance. Made on a budget of \u20b9550 million (US$8.2 million), the film was shot in Spain, India, Egypt and the United Kingdom. The story follows three friends, Arjun, Kabir, and Imraan who have been inseparable since childhood. They set off to Spain on a bachelor trip and meet Laila, who falls in love with Arjun and helps him overcome his problem of workaholism. Kabir and his fianc\u00e9e experience significant misunderstanding in the meanwhile, which they soon overcome. As part of the trip, each friend chooses a dangerous sport for the group to partake. The music and score was composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Initially expected to hit theatres on 27 May 2011, the release of the film was pushed back to 24 June, and once again to 15 July due to technical glitches in post-production. The film had a worldwide release in 1800 screens and was a critical and commercial success. It grossed \u20b91.53 billion (US$23 million) worldwide. After its theatrical run, the film was nominated for and won several awards in various categories, including two National Film Awards."

Out of his four daughters, two \u2013 Geeta and Babita \u2013 won gold and silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, respectively. The film will also focus on how he coached them personally against all odds ignoring people who made fun of him for preparing his daughters to become wrestlers.

            "My Name Is Khan is a 2010 Indian drama film directed by Karan Johar and produced by Hiroo Yash Johar and Gauri Khan and stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol in lead roles. The film was jointly produced by Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment and was distributed by FOX Star Entertainment, which had bought the rights for the film for a sum of \u20b9100 crore (US$15 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of 2010. It is also the highest buyover for any Indian film, surpassing Ghajini's record of \u20b990 crore (equivalent to \u20b9176 crore or US$26 million in 2016). Before its release, the film generated a great deal of publicity for itself due to three main reasons: first, the multiple political controversies surrounding the film and its lead actor; second, Khan's presence in the film (he was last seen in a leading actor role in December 2008, when Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was released); and third, the reunion of the \"golden pair\" of Khan and Kajol, who last appeared together in the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001. My Name Is Khan debuted in Abu Dhabi, UAE, on 10 February 2010. It premiered globally in cinemas on 12 February 2010. It was also screened as part of the 60th Berlin International Film Festival's official selection the same month. Upon its release, the film broke many box office records. My Name Is Khan was the highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at the time, which was then overtaken by 3 Idiots. Within four weeks, the film crossed the \u20b970 crore (US$10 million) mark in India and became the first film of 2010 to do so. In the overseas markets, the film grossed \u20b9110.34 crore (US$16 million). My Name Is Khan earned a worldwide gross of 200 crores. The film was released in India on DVD on 28 April 2010. Blu-ray in India, plus a DVD release worldwide followed on 10 August 2010."

Centered on the coal mafia of Dhanbad, and the underlying power struggles, politics and vengeance between three crime families, the Part 1 features ensemble cast with Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Huma Qureshi, Richa Chadda, Tigmanshu Dhulia in the major roles and its story spans from the early 1940s to mid-1990s and then to 2000's. Both parts were originally shot as a single film measuring a total of 319 minutes and screened at the 2012 Cannes Directors' Fortnight but since no Indian theatre would volunteer to screen a five plus hour film, it was divided into two parts for the Indian market. Kashyap plans to make another sequel, Gangs of Wasseypur 3 and has incorporated Zeishan Quadri as writer of the third part."

            "Bajirao Mastani is a 2015 Indian epic historical romance film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who also composed the music of the film. It is jointly produced by Bhansali and Eros International. The film stars Ranveer Singh as Bajirao I and Deepika Padukone as Mastani, with Priyanka Chopra playing Bajirao's first wife Kashibai. Tanvi Azmi, Vaibbhav Tatwawdi and Milind Soman appear in supporting roles. Based on the Marathi novel Raau by Nagnath S. Inamdar, the film narrates the story of the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao (1700-1740 AD) and his second wife Mastani. The film was in development for 15 years, with Bhansali wanting to make the film after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. However, several times, the production was delayed due to the changing cast. Principal photography started in mid 2014 after the casting of principal roles was finalised. The film was released on 18 December 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, cinematography, production design, costumes, music and performances, particularly of Chopra, and Singh. The film has grossed over \u20b9350 crore (US$52 million) at the box-office, emerging as a commercial success and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. The film received several accolades at various award ceremonies across India. At the 63rd National Film Awards, Bajirao Mastani received seven awards, including Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress for Azmi. The film received fourteen nominations at the 61st Filmfare Awards, and won nine awards including Best Film, Best Director for Bhansali, Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra."

Produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor under their banner Balaji Motion Pictures, in association with Anurag Kashyap's production house Phantom Films, it features Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and, Diljit Dosanjh in lead roles. On 4 June 2016, the Central Board of Film Certification sought a stay on the film's release citing that the themes dealt with in the film were too vulgar for the general audience. As a result, the producers were directed to make a total of 89 cuts in the film. However, on 13 June 2016, the Bombay High Court struck down the stay and gave permission for the film's national release, albeit with a single cut in the screenplay. The film was released worldwide on 17 June 2016. Made on a budget of \u20b9400 million (US$5.9 million), Udta Punjab has earned over \u20b9996 million (US$15 million) worldwide."

The story is based on the life of Milkha Singh, an Indian athlete who was a national champion runner and an Olympian. It stars Farhan Akhtar in the lead role with Pavan Malhotra and Art Malik in supporting roles and Sonam Kapoor in a cameo. Sports was coordinated by the American action director Rob Miller of ReelSports. Made on a budget of \u20b9300 million (US$4.5 million), the film released on 12 July 2013 and gathered a positive response from critics and audiences alike. It performed very well at the box office, eventually being declared a \"super hit\" domestically and hit overseas. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the sixth highest grossing 2013 Bollywood film worldwide and became the 21st film to gross \u20b91 billion (US$15 million). Singh and his daughter, Sonia Sanwalka, co-wrote his autobiography, titled The Race of My Life. The book inspired Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.

The Trust was founded in 2003 with the aim of assisting poor and needy sportspeople."

            "Neerja is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical thriller film directed by Ram Madhvani and written by Saiwyn Quadras and Sanyuktha Chawla Shaikh. It was produced by Atul Kasbekar's company, Bling Unplugged, alongside Vijay Singh's Fox Star Studios. The film features Sonam Kapoor as the title character, with Shabana Azmi, Yogendra Tiku and Shekhar Ravjiani in supporting roles. The plot centers on the Libyan-backed Abu Nidal Organization's hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan, on 5 September 1986. The film is shown from the point of view of the flight's head purser, Neerja Bhanot, who thwarted the hijack attempt by alerting the pilots, thus grounding the plane; Bhanot gave her life to help save 359 of the 379 passengers and crew on board. Development began in September 2014, when Kasbekar signed Madhvani and Kapoor for a film to be made by Bling Unplugged and Fox Star Studios. Saiwyn Quadras and Sanyuktha Chawla worked on the script, with principal photography taking place in Mumbai. The film features music by Vishal Khurana, with lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi. Neerja was released on 19 February 2016 to positive critical reception, with praise directed to Kapoor's performance, and became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist."

            "Kai Po Che! (also known as Kai Po Che: Brothers... for Life) is a 2013 Indian drama buddy film directed by Abhishek Kapoor based on Chetan Bhagat's novel The 3 Mistakes of My Life, with music by Amit Trivedi and lyrics by Swanand Kirkire. Sushant Singh Rajput, Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh star as the three main protagonists while Amrita Puri plays the female lead. The film title Kai Po Che! is originally a Gujarati phrase that means \"I have cut\" which refers to Makar Sankranti (known as Uttarayan in Gujarat) where one of the competitors uses his kite to cut off another competitors kite and yells \"Kai Po Che!\" The shooting started mid-April in Vadnagar and Ahmedabad. Set in Ahmedabad, the story revolves around three friends, Ishaan (Sushant Singh Rajput), Omi (Amit Sadh) and Govind (Rajkummar Rao), who want to start their own sports shop and sports academy; the film also revolves around the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and Godhra train burning. The film tracks their deep friendship, and innocence tarnished by religious politics and communal hatred. Kai Po Che! had a world premiere at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival on 13 February 2013 where it was the first ever Indian film to feature in the World Panorama section. Kai Po Che! released worldwide on 22 February 2013 and met with critical acclaim among Indian reviewers, but negative reviews internationally."

            "Talvar (English: Sword), released internationally as Guilty, is a 2015 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Meghna Gulzar and written by Vishal Bharadwaj. The film is based on the 2008 Noida double murder case, in which a teenage girl and her family servant were found murdered, and her parents were convicted for the crime. The film stars Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah in leading roles. The film was produced by Junglee Pictures, the films division of The Times of India Group. Originally titled Nyodda, the film's title was changed to Talvar in February 2015. The film was premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival in September. Talvar presents three contradictory accounts of the case, which variously portray the parents as guilty or innocent. Meghna Gulzar has stated that her script is completely objective and unbiased. However, a few reviewers have remarked that the film's Rashomon-style storytelling is designed to show the parents in a sympathetic light. At the 61st Filmfare Awards, Talvar was nominated for five awards, including Best Film, and it won the Filmfare Award for Best Editing (A. Sreekar Prasad). It also won Best Adapted Screenplay at the 63rd National Film Awards."

It stars Shahid Kapoor as the titular protagonist, and co-stars Tabu, Shraddha Kapoor and Kay Kay Menon. Irrfan Khan appears in an extended special appearance. The film is a modern-day adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet and Curfewed Night of Basharat Peer set amidst the insurgency-hit Kashmir conflicts of 1995 and civilian disappearances. Haider, a young student and a poet, returns to Kashmir at the peak of the conflict to seek answers about his father's disappearance and ends up being tugged into the politics of the state. Haider is the third installment of Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy after Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006). The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival, and released worldwide on 2 October 2014 to wide critical acclaim, and garnered attention from the media due to its controversial subject matter. The direction, performances of Kay Kay Menon, Tabu and Shahid Kapoor, screenplay, film score and editing received praise and garnered several accolades. Haider was the first Indian film to win the People's Choice Award at the Rome Film Festival. Among several awards and nominations in India, the film won five National Film Awards: Best Male Playback Singer, Best Dialogue, Best choreography, Best Costume Design, and Best Music Direction."

            "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian biographical sports film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. It based on the life of Indian cricketer and the current ODI and T20I captain of the Indian national cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

The film chronicles the life of Dhoni from a young age and the series of life events that finally culminates to his stardom in the realm of cricket. The idea of the biopic was put forward by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey, after encountering an incident at an airport after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. Development began two years later, with the consent of Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey was later approached to helm the film while he was working on Baby. Pandey recruited a number of people for researching into Dhoni's background and his life events. Dhoni eventually became a consultant on the film The film was released on 30 September 2016 by Fox Star Studios and received the widest release ever for a Bollywood film across 61 countries. In addition to being released in Hindi language, it was also dubbed in Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi languages, although the Marathi release was later cancelled due to opposition. Upon release, the film became a critical and commercial success. It is currently the fifth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2016 in India with \u20b91.16 billion (US$17 million) and has grossed over \u20b91.91 billion (US$28 million) globally."
